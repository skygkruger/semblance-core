## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using Semblance ("the Software"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Software.

## 2. License Grant

### 2.1 Open-Core Components (MIT/Apache-2.0)

The open-core components of Semblance are licensed under the MIT License and Apache License 2.0. You may use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the open-core components, subject to the terms of those licenses. The full license texts are included in the source repository.

### 2.2 Premium Components (Proprietary)

Certain premium features ("Digital Representative" capabilities) are proprietary software licensed to you under a separate end-user license. You may use these features on devices you own or control. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the proprietary components, except to the extent permitted by applicable law.

### 2.3 No Server License Required

Semblance runs entirely on your device. There is no server component, no cloud service, and no subscription required for the core product. Premium features are unlocked via a one-time or subscription purchase.

## 3. Your Data

### 3.1 Ownership

You own all data processed by Semblance. We claim no rights to your data. All data remains on your device under your exclusive control.

### 3.2 No Data Collection

Semblance does not collect, transmit, or store any user data on any server or cloud service operated by Veridian Synthetics. See our Privacy Policy for details.

### 3.3 Your Responsibility

You are responsible for the security of your device and your data. Semblance provides tools (encryption, audit trail, sandboxing) to help protect your data, but the security of your device is ultimately your responsibility.

## 4. Acceptable Use

You agree not to use Semblance to:

- Violate any applicable law or regulation
- Infringe on the rights of others
- Distribute malware or other harmful software
- Attempt to circumvent the premium feature licensing mechanism for commercial redistribution

## 5. Third-Party Services

When you connect third-party services to Semblance (email, calendar, financial accounts, etc.):

- You are responsible for complying with those services' terms of use
- Semblance acts as your agent, using your credentials, on your behalf
- Veridian Synthetics is not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or security of third-party services
- Third-party service credentials are stored locally on your device

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Semblance uses locally-running language models for reasoning and decision-making. Language models can produce incorrect, incomplete, or inappropriate outputs. You are responsible for reviewing and approving actions before they are executed (or configuring your autonomy preferences to allow autonomous execution at your own discretion).

## 7. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL VERIDIAN SYNTHETICS, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM:

- YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE
- ANY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE SOFTWARE ON YOUR BEHALF (INCLUDING IN AUTONOMOUS MODE)
- ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR LOCAL DATA
- ANY ERRORS, INACCURACIES, OR OMISSIONS IN THE SOFTWARE'S REASONING OR OUTPUT

## 8. Autonomy and Agent Actions

Semblance can take actions on your behalf (sending emails, scheduling meetings, managing subscriptions, etc.) based on your configured autonomy level:

- **Guardian mode:** All actions require your explicit approval
- **Partner mode:** Routine actions are autonomous; novel or high-stakes actions require approval
- **Alter Ego mode:** Nearly all actions are autonomous; only genuinely high-stakes actions require approval

You are responsible for configuring your autonomy preferences appropriately. All actions are logged in a tamper-evident audit trail and are reviewable within the application.

## 9. Updates

Semblance may check for updates from GitHub Releases. Update checks contain no identifying information. You can disable automatic update checks in Settings.

## 10. Termination

You may stop using Semblance at any time by uninstalling the Software. Upon uninstallation, all local data is removed from your device.

We may cease development or distribution of the Software at any time. Since the core is open source, the community may continue development independently.

## 11. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Updated Terms will be published in the application and source repository. Your continued use of Semblance after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 12. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

## 13. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
