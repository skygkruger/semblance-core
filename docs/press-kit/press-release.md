## Veridian Synthetics Launches Semblance: The First Sovereign Personal AI That Never Sends Your Data to the Cloud

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

*February 2026*

**Veridian Synthetics** today announced the launch of **Semblance**, a fully local personal AI that ingests a user's entire digital life — emails, files, calendar, messages, health data, financial records, and browser history — into a private knowledge graph running entirely on their device.

Unlike cloud-based AI assistants that require uploading personal data to remote servers, Semblance's AI Core process has zero network access, enforced at the operating system level. All reasoning, inference, and data storage happen locally. The open source architecture is publicly auditable, with an automated privacy audit running on every code commit.

### Alter Ego Mode

Semblance 1.0.0 ships with Alter Ego Mode, which allows the AI to act as the user's digital representative — responding to emails, managing calendar, canceling forgotten subscriptions, detecting dark patterns, and filling forms. Every action is cryptographically signed, logged to a tamper-evident audit trail, and reversible.

### Pricing and Availability

The core product is free with no limits or trial period. The Digital Representative tier, which includes Alter Ego Mode and sovereignty features, is available for $18 per month or $349 lifetime. Founding Member pricing of $199 lifetime is available to the first 500 users.

Semblance is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux (desktop) with iOS and Android mobile apps. The source code is available at github.com/skygkruger/semblance-core under MIT + Apache 2.0 dual license.

Fifteen percent of Digital Representative revenue funds free emotional wellness sanctuaries through the Open Sanctuary Model.

### Founder Quote

"We were promised connection. We got extraction," said Sky, founder of Veridian Synthetics. "Every AI assistant on the market requires you to upload your life to someone else's server. Semblance proves that the most capable personal AI is the one that never sends your data anywhere. Privacy isn't a limitation — it's the foundation that makes real capability possible."

### About Veridian Synthetics

Veridian Synthetics builds ethical, autonomous software that proves honest business practices can succeed. Founded on the belief that users respond to respectful design, the company develops technology that treats privacy as an architectural requirement rather than a marketing claim.
