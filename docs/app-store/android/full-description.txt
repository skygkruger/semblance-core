Semblance is a fully local personal AI that ingests your emails, files, calendar, messages, health data, and financial records into a private knowledge graph. It reasons about your life using on-device language models and acts as your agent in the world. Your data never leaves your device.

WHAT MAKES SEMBLANCE DIFFERENT

Cloud AI assistants start every session at zero. They know nothing about you. Semblance starts every session with the accumulated understanding of your entire digital life — because everything runs locally, permanently, on your device.

More capable because it's private.

PRIVACY ARCHITECTURE

Semblance's AI Core has zero network access — no HTTP, no WebSocket, no DNS. Enforced at the OS level, not just by policy. All external communication flows through a single auditable Gateway. Every action is cryptographically signed and logged. The core code is open source under MIT + Apache 2.0.

Five inviolable rules:
1. Zero Network in AI Core
2. Gateway Only communication
3. Cryptographic action signing
4. Zero telemetry of any kind
5. All data local only

PEER DEVICE

Semblance on Android is a peer device, not a companion app. It runs full on-device inference using llama.cpp optimized for ARM and can seamlessly hand off complex tasks to your desktop over local network with mutual TLS authentication.
