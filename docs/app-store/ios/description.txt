Semblance is a fully local personal AI that ingests your emails, files, calendar, messages, health data, and financial records into a private knowledge graph. It reasons about your life using on-device language models and acts as your agent in the world. Your data never leaves your device.

WHAT MAKES SEMBLANCE DIFFERENT

Cloud AI assistants start every session at zero. They know nothing about you beyond what you paste into a chat window. Semblance starts every session with the accumulated understanding of your entire digital life — because everything runs locally, permanently, on your device.

More capable because it's private.

PRIVACY ARCHITECTURE

Semblance's AI Core has zero network access — no HTTP, no WebSocket, no DNS. This is enforced at the OS level, not just by policy. All external communication flows through a single auditable Gateway. Every action is cryptographically signed and logged. The code is open source.

Five inviolable rules:
1. Zero Network in AI Core
2. Gateway Only communication
3. Cryptographic action signing
4. Zero telemetry
5. Local only data

PEER DEVICE

Semblance on mobile is a peer device, not a companion. It runs full on-device inference and can seamlessly hand off complex tasks to your desktop over your local network.
